# RSA Factoring Competition
This repository is simply an attempt to read in and factorize a number file.
and use RSA to compute their prime number

## Brief description of each file:
* '''factors''' - the factorization program (Usage: '''time ./factors tests/test00''')
* ''RSA''' - the software that determines whether or not prime numbers exist (Usage: '''prime ./rsa tests/rsa-1''')
* '''tests/files''' - the data-filled test file

### Environment
* Language: C 
* OS: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
